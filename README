compressed archives.


Requirements:

Libraries:
Gtk+2   2.4.0
Imlib2  1.1.2


Filetypes:

These are configurable from the GUI.

ZIP:
unzip
http://www.info-zip.org/
tested: UnZip 5.52 of 28 February 2005, by Info-ZIP.

RAR:
unrar version 3.4.3
http://www.rarlabs.com/rar_add.htm
Even the shareware program rar can be used instead of this (they have 
the same command line arguments)
NOTE: unrar version 3.6.2 appears to have some problems with filenames 
of archived files supplied from the command line (in some locales).
Also rar version 3.51 appears to have the same problems.

TAR gz/bz2
some version of tar that supports piping through the decompression 
programs in one command.
tested: GNU tar 1.15.1 with bzip2 1.0.4 and gzip 1.3.11


Installation:

The normal procedure should work:

./configure
make

The name of the generated binary is "sequview". It can be run straight 
from the src/ -directory.

The program generates directory ~/.sequview where it stores the 
configuration and the temporary files.
